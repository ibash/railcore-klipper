# Above is example 300x300 bed to coorelate with macros and movements below.
# This example is for a fixed dock, fixed gantry/carraige and moving bed motion system. 
# RailCore, Ender5, V-Core3, etc...
# For moving gantry sytem like Voron 2.4, there are some subltle things to change.
# We have attempetd indicate those in the comments throughout the example code.   
# Z elevation is shown in movements to ensure adequate Z elevation to avoid crashes. 
# With the coupling magnets +/- 2mm of the nozzle the probe trigger height is on the
# ordeer of 12mm, so 15mm is used as a safe height.
#
# the printer.cfg-snip.txt has the following config settings 
# # 
# #...
# # add this include statement at the head of the config file
# [include euclid.cfg]
# #
#
# #
# # enable enable_force_move to enable FORCE_MOVE and SET_KINEMATIC_POSIITION
# enable_force_move:true
# # ...
#
# It is assumed that there is a seperate Z-endstop that is used to home Z
# IF YOU ARE USING PROBE AS ENDSTOP AND PROBE homing_overide must be altered
#
# some configurtions may need FORCE_MOVE enabled for kinematic position functionS
